Idea to play inter-crypto exchange rates

Thesis: Rather than go outright long/short a cryptocurrency, use relative value plays to minimize volatility and take advantage of reversion to the mean for cryptocurrencies that have been overbought.

Specifically, short ETH-BTC exchange rate on the thesis that Ether has become significantly over bought over the last several months (May2017-Sep2017) due to irrational investors riding the 'currency/commodity' wave.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is the cornerstone of the crypto market and will be used as a benchmark.

To short ETH-BTC, will need to borrow ETH holdings and convert to BTC for the duration of the trade. Assume interest rate paid to the owner of ETH. 

# Process:
Player A - borrows ETH

Player B - loans ETH


### Time 0:

1. B converts X(0) ETH into Y(0) BTC at current exchange rate E(0)

### Time 1:
1. B converts Y(1) BTC back into X(1) ETH at current exchange rate E(1)
2. Find the difference in ETH amounts between Time 1 and Time 0

      X(1) - X(0)

3. The $ value of this difference based on the price of ETH at Time 1 is the $ exchanged between Player A and B

A pays B interest based on $ value of ETH at the beginning of each month
